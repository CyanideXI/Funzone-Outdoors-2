# Funzone-Outdoors
Funzone Website 
Hunter Williams-HTML 
Zachariah Cunningham-CSS
We chose Funzone Outdoors as our company because Hunter, works for them and at the time of starting the website build, Funzone did not have a functioning website. Funzone has one now but it is bland and we personaly did not enjoy the websites feel or functionality.
We started to code from scratch and went from using CSS to Bootstrap as a way to style the website. We then tried to use W3CSS to style the website but ultimatly ended up using CSS. The final website is the fourth iteration of the beginning project.
